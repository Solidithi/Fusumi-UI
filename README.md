## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Service Consumption & Debt-NFT Minting**  
   - When a service is consumed and payment is not immediate, Fusumi automatically generates a debt-NFT that encapsulates the debt owed by the user (debtor) to the business (creditor). These aren't just digital receipts—they're redeemable assets with real financial value.

2. **Liquidity Marketplace Trading**  
   - Businesses can convert their future receivables into present capital by selling debt-NFTs to third-party investors on our dedicated liquidity marketplace. This transforms traditional accounts receivable into immediate cash flow.

3. **Fractionalization & Investment Opportunities**  
   - Single debt-NFTs can be divided into multiple smaller fractional NFTs, each representing a percentage of ownership. Payments to the root NFT automatically distribute proportionally to all fractional holders, creating granular investment opportunities.

4. **Smart Contract Lifecycle Management**  
   - Built on Move language with smart contracts governing the entire debt lifecycle from issuance and transfer to payment and fractionalization. Dynamic NFT URIs reflect real-time ownership and payment status with integrated credit scoring for risk mitigation.
